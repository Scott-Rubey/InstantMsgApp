# IMProtocol
This is a basic instant messaging application created as part of my Internetworking Protocols course, Fall 2020.
It implements the RFC included herein, also created as part of this course.  The implementation provides a means
in which a single multi-threaded server can connect to many clients; users may create/join/leave chat rooms, and
may exchange messages with other members of the chat room via socket I/O.
